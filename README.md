This project was built using Python programming.

Here we developed a real time operating student attendance system which means the identification process must be done within defined time constraints to prevent omission. The extracted features from facial images which represent the identity of the students have to be consistent towards a change in background, illumination, pose and expression. High accuracy and fast computation time will be the evaluation points of the performance
